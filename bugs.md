### 1. `/t admin delete <townName>` doesn't work. 
```
[22:44:30 INFO]: Rooftop issued server command: /t admin delete test
[22:44:31 WARN]: [TownPal] Plugin TownPal vfinal generated an exception while executing task 212

```

It does give a successful deletion messsage, yet if I try do another command like `/t create <name>` it still says I am in a town. 

### 2. `/t sethome` changes
You must not be able to:
Set a town home in another town's claim
Set a town home if the land isn't claimed
