# War System - TownPal Plugin

The War System in the TownPal plugin allows towns to engage in PvP conflicts with each other. Once two towns become enemies, they automatically declare war, enabling players from both towns to fight freely in each other's territories.

## Features:

### 1. **Automatic War Declaration**
- When two towns become enemies, war is automatically declared between them.
- Players can freely PvP in each other's claimed areas during war.

### 2. **War Duration**
- By default, wars last for a specified duration (e.g., 24 hours). The war ends after this time or if one side surrenders or calls for a truce.

### 3. **Truce and Surrender**
- Towns can end a war before the duration expires by declaring a truce or surrendering.
- **Truce**: A mutual agreement between towns to stop fighting for a set period.
- **Surrender**: A town may choose to surrender, ending the war immediately.

## War Mechanics:

- **PvP**: Players from towns at war can freely PvP within each other's claimed territories.
- **End Conditions**: Wars can end early if both towns agree to a truce or if one town surrenders.
- **Notifications**: When a town declares war on another, all members of both towns are notified.
